# Image-recognition-AdjwaMedjool

The dataset we are using is the "Ajwa or Medjool" dataset, available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/879/ajwa+or+medjool. This dataset is a balanced dataset designed to classify two categories of organic Saudi dates. It consists of three subsets: 1) a dataset containing handcrafted features to classify 20 date fruits into two types of organic dates (Ajwa or Medjool); 2) an image dataset of Ajwa and Medjool dates (200 images from the aforementioned 20 fruits); and 3) a dataset containing tabular data with features automatically generated using deep learning to classify the two types of organic dates (Ajwa or Medjool). This study is considered the first Arabic-language work to utilize both shallow machine learning and deep learning to create accurate models for classifying organic Saudi dates, enabling scholars, researchers, and developers to build machine learning applications for classifying Saudi dates in various forms, such as websites, mobile applications, microcontrollers, tiny machine learning, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
